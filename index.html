          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>Elements inside the head are not typically seen</li>
          <li>
            HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never

            A !DOCTYPE html declaration tells the browser what document type it

          <li>
            Some of the head elements include:
            <ul>
              <li>title: defines the title of a webpage</li>
              <li>style: defines the CSS style associated to webpage</li>
              <li>base: defiens the base URL for a webpage,</li>
              <li>link: connects an external resource to the HTML document</li>
              <li>
                meta: defines the metadata such as character set, descriptions
                and keywords for the website

          <li>
            The body element is an example of a semantic HTML - the element name
            describes its content and the role it plays on the website
          </li>
          <li>
            Semantic HTML is best practice to use as it makes it easier for
            other developers to read, but also makes the website more accessible
            for those who use assitive technologies such as screen readers
          </li>
          <li>Some of the body elements include:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              h1-h6: represents the level of the heading a given text block
              represents with 'h1' being the largest
            </li>
            <li>p: represents a paragraph or text block</li>
            <li>
              ul, ol, li: the elements represent unordered, ordered and list
              items respectively and create bullet or numbered lists
            </li>
            <li>
              img: contains information about images displayed on the webpage
              and contain attributes within it such as src (the location of the
              image), the alt text and the width and height
            </li>
            <li>
              br: creates a line of empty space or a line break between two
              content blocks

        <h2>CSS</h2>

          <li>
            It is possible to style an element directly in the HTML file using
            inline CSS. This internal stylesheet contains CSS rules within the
            head section of a HTML file.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is important to consider seperation of concerns however as each
            section of code should have its own responsiblity
          </li>
          <li>
            To link the external style sheet to a html file, we use a link
            element. This element contains two attributes rel ( the relationship
            of the document with the linked source) and href (specifies location
            of the external resource)
          </li>
          <li>A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block</li>
          <li>
            A period preceding a section class title designates it as a class
            selector (eg .card). Any html elements assigned to the class will
            gain property assignments from the CSS
          </li>
          <li>
            Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by
            semantic references such as gray or blue or by its hexadecimal code
          </li>
          <li>
            A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an
            element.
          </li>
          <li>
            A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside
            an element.
          </li>

          <li>git commit -m “<your message here>”: -m flag adds a commit message and commits files locally</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pulls any changes from the current branch to ensure everything is up to date</li>
